Hello and welcome to the central bank trading strategies course. This is the first course of its type in the world. A morning which we're trying to look at the opportunities that surround central bank decisions. These are the institutions that control the money supply, the interest rate that we pay and therefore they control the cost of money. The decisions that a central bank make are often the most important decisions that you're going to get affecting any market. As such, the opportunities around a central bank decision are also some of the largest opportunities that you will see in a course of a month, a year or in some cases even people's whole careers. For this reason, what we want to do is create a course that allows people to trade these opportunities from the point of having a framework, a process, a way of actually accessing these opportunities, not to see them as potentially dangerous volatile situations where there's lots of movements, lots of extreme trading dynamics that don't appear on a day to day situation. So we're going to try and create a course that allows people to trade these events with confidence, with conviction and with a repeatable process and strategy.
